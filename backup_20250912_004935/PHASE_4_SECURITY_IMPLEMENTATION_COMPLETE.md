## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. **Deploy Security Infrastructure**
```bash
# Start security services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.security.yml up -d

# Verify deployment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.security.yml ps
```

### 2. **Configure CI/CD Security**
- **GitHub**: Configure secrets (HARBOR_USERNAME, HARBOR_PASSWORD, COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY, SNYK_TOKEN)
- **GitLab**: Configure variables in CI/CD settings
- **Enable security scanning**: Workflows automatically trigger on code commits

### 3. **Deploy Kubernetes Security Policies**
```bash
# Apply security policies
kubectl apply -f security/policies/opa-security-policy.rego
kubectl apply -f security/policies/k8s-admission-policy.yaml

# Deploy monitoring
kubectl apply -f security/configs/prometheus.yml
```

### 4. **Test Security Implementation**
```bash
# Run comprehensive security scan
./security/scripts/comprehensive-scan.sh gameforge:latest

# Test vulnerability remediation
./security/scripts/auto-remediation.sh

# Test secure deployment
./security/scripts/secure-deploy.sh gameforge:latest production
```
