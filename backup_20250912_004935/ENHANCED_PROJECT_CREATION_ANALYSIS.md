}
```

### Phase 2: Template System (Weeks 3-4)
```typescript
// Template Data Structure
GameTemplate {
  id: string
  name: string
  category: 'rpg' | 'scifi' | 'arcade' | etc
  preview: string // GIF/video path
  customizationOptions: {
    themes: string[]
    artStyles: string[]
    features: string[]
  }
  basePrompt: string // AI generation prompt
  estimatedTime: string
  complexity: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced'
}
```

### Phase 3: Advanced AI Pipeline (Weeks 5-6)
```typescript
// Multi-stage Generation Process
1. Concept Analysis (30s) - Genre detection, complexity assessment
2. User Validation - Review and refine before generation
3. Content Creation (2-3min) - Story, assets, gameplay, code
4. Integration & Testing (1-2min) - Assembly and QA
```

### Phase 4: Community Features (Weeks 7-8)
- Template sharing marketplace
- Community project gallery
- Remix and fork functionality
- Collaborative creation tools

## Expected Impact Metrics
