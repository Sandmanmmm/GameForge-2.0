## Quick Start Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (for production)
- GitHub/GitLab repository with CI/CD enabled
- SSL certificates for secure communications

### 1. Deploy Security Infrastructure
```bash
# Start multi-scanner infrastructure
docker-compose -f docker-compose.security.yml up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.security.yml ps
```

### 2. Configure CI/CD Security Pipelines

#### GitHub Actions
```bash
# Copy GitHub Actions workflow
cp .github/workflows/security-scan.yml .github/workflows/

# Set required secrets in GitHub:
# - HARBOR_USERNAME
# - HARBOR_PASSWORD  
# - COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY
# - SNYK_TOKEN
```

#### GitLab CI
```bash
# Copy GitLab CI configuration
cp ci/gitlab/.gitlab-ci-security.yml .gitlab-ci.yml

# Set required variables in GitLab:
# - HARBOR_USERNAME
# - HARBOR_PASSWORD
# - COSIGN_PRIVATE_KEY
# - SNYK_TOKEN
```

### 3. Deploy Kubernetes Security Policies
```bash
# Apply OPA Gatekeeper policies
kubectl apply -f security/policies/opa-security-policy.rego

# Apply admission controller
kubectl apply -f security/policies/k8s-admission-policy.yaml

# Apply network policies
kubectl apply -f security/configs/network-policy.yaml
```

### 4. Configure Monitoring and Alerting
```bash
# Deploy Prometheus with security metrics
kubectl apply -f security/configs/prometheus.yml

# Import Grafana security dashboard
# Dashboard JSON: security/dashboards/security-dashboard.json

# Configure DefectDojo (if using)
# Follow DefectDojo setup instructions in security/configs/defectdojo/
```

## Security Scanning Workflow

### 1. Automated Scanning in CI/CD
Every code commit triggers:
- SAST analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning
- License compliance checking
- Secrets detection

### 2. Security Gates
Deployments are blocked if:
- Critical vulnerabilities found
- High vulnerabilities exceed threshold (>5)
- Policy violations detected
- Image not signed
- Compliance checks fail

### 3. Manual Security Operations

#### Comprehensive Security Scan
```bash
# Run complete security analysis
./security/scripts/comprehensive-scan.sh gameforge:latest

# View aggregated results
cat security/reports/scan-summary.json
```

#### Vulnerability Remediation
```bash
# Analyze and suggest fixes
./security/scripts/auto-remediation.sh

# Apply automatic fixes (optional)
AUTO_FIX=true ./security/scripts/auto-remediation.sh
```

#### Secure Deployment
```bash
# Deploy with security validation
./security/scripts/secure-deploy.sh gameforge:latest production
```

## Security Policies

### Image Security Requirements
- Base images must be from approved registries
- Images must be scanned and vulnerability-free (critical/high)
- Images must be signed with Cosign
- Images must run as non-root user
- Images must have resource limits

### Network Security
- All pod-to-pod communication encrypted
- Network policies restrict traffic
- Ingress traffic requires TLS
- Egress traffic whitelisted

### Runtime Security
- Security contexts enforced
- AppArmor/SELinux profiles applied
- Read-only root filesystems
- Capability dropping
- Seccomp profiles enabled

## Compliance and Reporting

### Automated Reports
- Daily vulnerability reports
- Weekly compliance summaries
- Monthly security posture assessments
- Real-time security incidents

### Compliance Frameworks
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- CIS Kubernetes Benchmark
- OWASP Container Security
- SOC 2 Type II controls

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- Vulnerability discovery rate
- Mean time to remediation (MTTR)
- Policy violation frequency
- Image signing compliance
- Security scan coverage

### Alert Conditions
- Critical vulnerabilities discovered
- Policy violations detected
- Security scan failures
- Unauthorized image deployments
- Anomalous network activity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Scanner Not Working
```bash
# Check scanner logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.security.yml logs trivy-server

# Restart scanner
docker-compose -f docker-compose.security.yml restart trivy-server
```

#### Policy Violations
```bash
# Check admission controller logs
kubectl logs -n gatekeeper admission-controller

# Review policy definitions
kubectl get constrainttemplates
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Failures
```bash
# Check pipeline logs for security step failures
# Common fixes:
# - Update vulnerability databases
# - Adjust security thresholds
# - Fix policy violations
```

## Best Practices

### Development
- Scan images locally before committing
- Use approved base images
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow secure coding practices
- Regular security training

### Operations
- Monitor security metrics daily
- Review and update policies monthly
- Conduct security assessments quarterly
- Update scanner databases regularly
- Test incident response procedures

### Maintenance
- Update security tools regularly
- Review and tune alert thresholds
- Archive old vulnerability reports
- Update compliance mappings
- Backup security configurations
