# AI Asset Generator - Proper Integration Complete ✅

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: The AI Asset Generator was buried inside the individual Asset Editor, making it hard to discover and use for creating new assets.

**Solution**: Moved the AI Asset Generator to the main **Asset Gallery** where it belongs - as the primary tool for creating new assets.

## 🚀 What's Been Implemented

### ✅ **New Standalone AI Asset Generator Component**
- **Location**: `src/components/AIAssetGenerator.tsx`

- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into the main Asset Gallery

### ✅ **Key Features of the New AI Generator**

#### **1. Prominent Placement**
- **Top of Asset Gallery**: First thing users see when viewing assets
- **Collapsible Interface**: Can be minimized but easily accessible
- **Visual Prominence**: Purple/blue gradient design that stands out

#### **2. Streamlined User Experience**
- **Quick Templates**: One-click buttons for Character, Environment, Weapon, UI Element
- **Visual Style Selection**: Popular AI-optimized presets prominently displayed
- **Simple Prompt Interface**: Large, clear text area for descriptions

#### **Smart Placement**
```tsx
// Integrated at the top of AssetGallery component
<AIAssetGenerator
  onAssetGenerated={handleAssetGenerated}
  onClose={() => setShowAIGenerator(false)}
/>
```

#### **State Management**
- Generated assets are properly tracked and integrated
