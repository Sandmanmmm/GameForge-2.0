## 🚨 Critical Gaps Requiring Attention

### High Priority (Required for Production):

1. **Soft Delete Implementation**
   ```python
   # Add to all models
   deleted_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=True, index=True)
   is_deleted = Column(Boolean, default=False, index=True)
   ```

2. **JSONB Fields for Flexibility**
   ```python
   # Example enhancement
   from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import JSONB
   
   metadata = Column(JSONB, default=dict)  # Instead of JSON
   ```

3. **Vector Embeddings for Search**
   ```python
   # Requires pgvector extension
   from pgvector.sqlalchemy import Vector
   
   embedding = Column(Vector(1536))  # For semantic search
   ```

### Medium Priority (Enterprise Features):

4. **Missing Models:**
   - `Subscription` model for billing management
   - `Notification` model for user alerts
   - `Dataset` model for ML data management
   - `DriftEvent` model for ML monitoring

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements):

5. **Expanded Time-series Analytics**
6. **Advanced Multi-tenancy Features**

---

## 🎯 Specific Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Quick Wins (1-2 weeks):

**Add Soft Delete Mixin:**
```python
class SoftDeleteMixin:
    deleted_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=True, index=True)
    is_deleted = Column(Boolean, default=False, index=True)
    
    def soft_delete(self):
        self.deleted_at = datetime.utcnow()
        self.is_deleted = True
```

**Upgrade JSON to JSONB:**
```python
# Replace all JSON columns with JSONB for better performance
from sqlalchemy.dialects.postgresql import JSONB

# Example migration
metadata = Column(JSONB, default=dict)  # Better indexing and querying
```

### 2. Medium-term Enhancements (3-4 weeks):

**Add Missing Models:**
```python
class Subscription(Base):
    """User subscription plans."""
    __tablename__ = "subscriptions"
    
    id = Column(String, primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))
    user_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    plan_type = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    status = Column(String(20), default="active")
    billing_cycle = Column(String(20))  # monthly, yearly
    amount = Column(Float, nullable=False)
    expires_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=False)

class Notification(Base):
    """User and system notifications."""
    __tablename__ = "notifications"
    
    id = Column(String, primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))
    user_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("users.id"))
    title = Column(String(200), nullable=False)
    message = Column(Text, nullable=False)
    notification_type = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    is_read = Column(Boolean, default=False)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
```

### 3. Advanced Features (4-6 weeks):

**Vector Embeddings for Semantic Search:**
```python
# Requires: pip install pgvector
from pgvector.sqlalchemy import Vector

class Asset(Base):
    # ... existing fields ...
    embedding = Column(Vector(1536))  # OpenAI embedding dimension
    
    def update_embedding(self, text_content: str):
        """Update semantic embedding for search."""
        # Integration with OpenAI embeddings
        pass
```
