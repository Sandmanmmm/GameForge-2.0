## üö® **Common Issues & Solutions**

### GitHub Issues

**‚ùå "The redirect_uri MUST match the registered callback URL"**
- Solution: Double-check your callback URL is exactly: `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/github/callback`

**‚ùå "Bad credentials"**
- Solution: Verify your Client ID and Client Secret in the `.env` file

### Google Issues

**‚ùå "Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"**
- Solution: Ensure redirect URI is exactly: `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/google/callback`

**‚ùå "This app isn't verified"**
- Solution: Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Go to GameForge (unsafe)" (this is normal in development)

**‚ùå "access_blocked"**
- Solution: Make sure you added your email as a test user in the OAuth consent screen
