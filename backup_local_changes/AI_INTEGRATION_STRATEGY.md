# AI Integration Strategy for GameForge

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation strategy for integrating real AI services (GPT, Claude, DALL-E, etc.) to generate actual game assets based on detailed project information.

## Current System Analysis

### Existing Components
1. **aiMockGenerator.ts** - Mock AI generator with predefined templates
2. **realTemplateGeneratorClean.ts** - Template-based generation system
3. **Enhanced Project Creation Dialog** - Detailed user input collection
4. **Asset Type Definitions** - Complete TypeScript interfaces for all asset types

### Data Flow
```
User Input → Detailed Concept → Comprehensive Prompt → AI Services → Real Assets → Game Project
```

## AI Integration Architecture
