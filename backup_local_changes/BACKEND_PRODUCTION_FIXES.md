# üîß Backend Production Issues Analysis & Fixes

## üö® **Issue Identified**

The backend is shutting down when receiving API requests due to:

1. **Unhandled Promise Rejections** in AI controller
2. **Missing Error Boundaries** in async operations  
3. **Service Connection Failures** causing process crashes
4. **Missing Production Error Handling**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Production Fixes Applied**

### **1. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added try-catch blocks around all async operations
- Implemented graceful error responses instead of crashes
- Added service health checks with fallbacks

### **2. Connection Resilience** 
- SDXL service connection timeout handling
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Better logging for debugging production issues

### **3. Request Validation**
- Input validation to prevent malformed requests
- Type checking for all API parameters
- Sanitization of user inputs

### **4. Process Stability**
- Removed process.exit() calls from error handlers
- Added proper async/await error handling
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern for external services

## ‚úÖ **Quick Fix Implementation**

The main issue is in the AI controller where async operations aren't properly handled. Here's the fix:

1. **Better Error Boundaries**: Wrap all async operations
2. **Service Health Checks**: Verify SDXL service before requests
3. **Fallback Responses**: Return errors instead of crashing
4. **Proper Logging**: Debug production issues

This will ensure the backend stays running even when the SDXL service has issues.
