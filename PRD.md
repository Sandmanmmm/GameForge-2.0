## Essential Features

### Game Idea Input & Project Creation
- **Functionality**: Text input field that accepts game concept descriptions and generates new projects
- **Purpose**: Primary entry point that transforms creative ideas into structured development projects
- **Trigger**: User types game concept and clicks "Create Project" or presses Enter
- **Progression**: Input prompt → AI processing animation → Project card creation → Dashboard update → Project detail view
- **Success criteria**: Project appears in dashboard with generated metadata, pipeline initialized, placeholder content populated

### Interactive Pipeline Visualization  
- **Functionality**: Visual node-based representation of game development stages with drag-and-drop reordering
- **Purpose**: Provides clear overview of development progress and allows customization of workflow
- **Trigger**: User clicks on pipeline view or drags pipeline nodes
- **Progression**: Pipeline display → Node selection → Drag interaction → Drop validation → Pipeline update → Progress recalculation
- **Success criteria**: Pipeline updates visually, maintains logical dependencies, saves reordered workflow

### Dynamic Project Management
- **Functionality**: Animated project cards showing status, progress, and quick preview information
- **Purpose**: Gives users immediate visibility into all projects and their current state
- **Trigger**: User navigates to dashboard or updates project status
- **Progression**: Dashboard load → Card animation sequence → Status indicators update → Preview content display
- **Success criteria**: Cards display current information, animations feel smooth and purposeful, status changes reflect immediately

### AI Creative Assistant Interface
- **Functionality**: Chat-style sidebar panel for AI interaction and guidance
- **Purpose**: Provides intelligent assistance and creative suggestions throughout development
- **Trigger**: User clicks AI assistant panel or asks for help
- **Progression**: Panel activation → Context awareness → Suggestion generation → Interactive response → Action integration
- **Success criteria**: Panel feels responsive and intelligent, integrates seamlessly with workflow, provides contextual assistance

### Multi-Stage Content Management
- **Functionality**: Organized sections for Story & Lore, Assets, Gameplay, QA, and Publishing
- **Purpose**: Structures the complex game development process into manageable, focused areas
- **Trigger**: User navigates between sections via sidebar or project workflow
- **Progression**: Section selection → Content loading → Context-specific tools display → Work area preparation
- **Success criteria**: Each section feels distinct yet connected, tools are contextually relevant, navigation is seamless

## Edge Case Handling

- **Empty State Management**: Dashboard shows inspiring onboarding flow when no projects exist
- **Long Project Names**: Text truncation with hover tooltips for full content
- **Pipeline Conflicts**: Visual feedback prevents invalid node arrangements and dependency violations
- **Offline Functionality**: Local state management maintains work progress during connectivity issues
- **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading and virtualization for large project lists and content areas

## Design Direction

The design should evoke the feeling of working in a high-tech creative studio - think Figma meets Blender meets Iron Man's workshop interface, with sleek gradients, subtle particle effects, and glass morphism elements that make users feel like they're using professional creative software.

## Color Selection

Triadic (three equally spaced colors) - Using deep blues, vibrant purples, and accent golds to create a futuristic yet creative atmosphere that suggests both technology and imagination.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Space Blue `oklch(0.25 0.15 240)` - Conveys professionalism and technological sophistication
- **Secondary Colors**: 
  - Cosmic Purple `oklch(0.35 0.2 280)` for creative elements and AI features
  - Warm Charcoal `oklch(0.15 0.02 240)` for backgrounds and secondary surfaces
- **Accent Color**: Electric Gold `oklch(0.75 0.15 85)` - Attention-grabbing highlight for CTAs, active states, and success indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background (Deep Space Blue): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Card (Warm Charcoal): Light Gray text `oklch(0.85 0.02 240)` - Ratio 8.1:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Space Blue): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 14.2:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Cosmic Purple): White text `oklch(0.98 0 0)` - Ratio 9.8:1 ✓
  - Accent (Electric Gold): Dark Blue text `oklch(0.2 0.1 240)` - Ratio 5.2:1 ✓
  - Muted (Dark Blue-Gray): Light text `oklch(0.75 0.05 240)` - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Typography should convey cutting-edge technology and creative professionalism - using Inter for its technical clarity combined with subtle character that suggests innovation without sacrificing readability.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Platform Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter SemiBold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Project Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Interface Text): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Caption (Meta Information): Inter Regular/12px/wide letter spacing
  - Code (Technical Details): JetBrains Mono Regular/13px/normal spacing

## Animations

Animations should feel sophisticated and purposeful - like working with professional creative software where every interaction provides satisfying feedback that enhances rather than distracts from the creative process.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion communicates the flow of creative energy through the development pipeline, with elements that pulse, flow, and connect to show the living nature of game development
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary actions get bold, satisfying animations (project creation, pipeline updates), while secondary interactions use subtle micro-animations (hover states, focus indicators)

## Component Selection

- **Components**: 
  - `Card` with custom glassmorphism styling for project displays
  - `Dialog` for project creation and detailed editing
  - `Sidebar` for main navigation with collapsible sections
  - `Tabs` for switching between development stages
  - `Progress` with custom styling for pipeline completion indicators
  - `Input` with enhanced focus states and floating labels
  - `Button` with multiple variants (primary, secondary, ghost) and loading states
  - `Badge` for status indicators and tags
  - `Separator` for visual organization
  - `ScrollArea` for content areas and chat interfaces

  - Gamepad, Palette, Code, Waveform, TestTube, and Rocket for section navigation
  - Plus, Play, Settings for primary actions
  - ChevronRight, CaretDown for navigation and expansion states

- **Spacing**: 
  - Base unit of 4px (1 Tailwind unit) for micro-spacing
  - 16px (4 units) for component internal padding
  - 24px (6 units) for section spacing
  - 32px (8 units) for major layout divisions

- **Mobile**: 
  - Collapsible sidebar transforms to bottom navigation on mobile
  - Project cards stack vertically with touch-friendly sizing
