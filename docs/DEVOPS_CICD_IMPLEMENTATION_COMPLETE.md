## Architecture

### 1. Policy-as-Code Framework

**Location**: `ci/policies/`

```
ci/policies/
├── security.rego      # Container security, network policies, RBAC
├── compliance.rego    # Governance, naming conventions, resource limits
└── docker.rego        # Docker Compose validation
```

**Key Features**:
- Container security validation (non-root users, read-only filesystems)
- Resource limit enforcement
- Network policy requirements
- Image security scanning integration
- Naming convention compliance

### 2. Blue/Green Deployment System

**Location**: `ci/deployment/`

```
ci/deployment/
├── blue-green-deploy.sh       # Main deployment orchestration
├── rollback.sh               # Automated rollback system
├── blue-green-service.yaml   # Kubernetes service configuration
├── deployment-config.yaml    # Environment configurations
└── monitor-deployment.sh     # Real-time deployment monitoring
```

**Key Features**:
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Automated health checks and validation
- Canary traffic routing
- Instant rollback capabilities
- Comprehensive monitoring integration

### 3. Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline

**Location**: `ci/gitlab/.gitlab-ci-enhanced.yml`

**Pipeline Stages**:
1. **Security Analysis** - SAST, DAST, dependency scanning
2. **Policy Validation** - OPA policy checks on infrastructure
3. **Build** - Container image creation with SBOM generation
4. **Container Scan** - Security scanning of built images
5. **Compliance Check** - Governance and compliance validation
6. **Security Gate** - Automated security approval gate
7. **Deploy Staging** - Blue/green deployment to staging
8. **Integration Tests** - Comprehensive API and functionality tests
9. **Deploy Production** - Blue/green deployment to production
10. **Post-Deployment** - Monitoring and validation

## Implementation Details

### Policy Validation

The OPA policies enforce:

**Security Requirements**:
- Containers must run as non-root users
- Read-only root filesystems required
- All Linux capabilities dropped
- No privileged containers allowed
- Network policies required for all deployments

**Compliance Requirements**:
- Standardized naming conventions
- Required labels (app, version, environment, team)
- Resource limits enforcement
- Approved namespace usage only

**Docker Compose Validation**:
- Security contexts properly configured
- No host networking or privileged modes
- Volume mounts restricted
- Resource limits defined

### Blue/Green Deployment Process

1. **Pre-deployment Validation**:
   - Policy compliance checks
   - Security scanning results
   - Health check endpoint verification

2. **Deployment Execution**:
   - Deploy new version to inactive environment (blue/green)
   - Run comprehensive health checks
   - Validate application functionality
   - Perform smoke tests

3. **Traffic Switching**:
   - Gradual traffic migration (canary → full)
   - Real-time monitoring during switch
   - Automated rollback on failure detection

4. **Post-deployment**:
   - Performance baseline validation
   - Monitoring system integration
   - Alert configuration updates

### Monitoring and Observability

**Deployment Monitoring**:
- Real-time deployment status dashboard
- Health check monitoring
- Performance metrics tracking
- Traffic distribution visualization

**Integration with Existing Stack**:
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Jaeger distributed tracing
- AlertManager notifications
- Elasticsearch log aggregation

## Usage Guide

### 1. Running Policy Validation

```bash
# Validate all infrastructure
cd ci/tests
chmod +x test-policies.sh
./test-policies.sh

# Validate specific configurations
conftest verify --policy ci/policies k8s/
conftest verify --policy ci/policies docker-compose.yml
```

### 2. Executing Blue/Green Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to staging
cd ci/deployment
chmod +x blue-green-deploy.sh
./blue-green-deploy.sh --version v1.2.3 --environment staging --namespace gameforge-staging

# Deploy to production
./blue-green-deploy.sh --version v1.2.3 --environment production --namespace gameforge
```

### 3. Monitoring Deployments

```bash
# Real-time monitoring
cd ci/deployment
chmod +x monitor-deployment.sh
./monitor-deployment.sh gameforge gameforge-api 300 monitor

# Generate deployment report
./monitor-deployment.sh gameforge gameforge-api 0 report

# Check current status
./monitor-deployment.sh gameforge gameforge-api 0 status
```

### 4. Emergency Rollback

```bash
# Automated rollback
cd ci/deployment
chmod +x rollback.sh
./rollback.sh --environment production --namespace gameforge --force
```

## GitLab CI/CD Configuration

### Required Variables

Set these in GitLab CI/CD settings:

```bash
# Kubernetes Configuration
KUBE_CONFIG_STAGING      # Base64 encoded kubeconfig for staging
KUBE_CONFIG_PRODUCTION   # Base64 encoded kubeconfig for production

# Container Registry
CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE        # Container registry URL
CI_REGISTRY_USER         # Registry username
CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD     # Registry password

# Notifications
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL        # Slack webhook for notifications

# Database
DB_PASSWORD              # Database password
```

### Pipeline Triggers

- **Automatic**: All pushes to `main` branch
- **Manual Gates**: 
  - Staging deployment
  - Production deployment gate
  - Production deployment
  - Emergency rollback

### Approval Process

1. **Automated Approval**: Security scans, policy validation, tests
2. **Manual Approval**: Production deployment gate
