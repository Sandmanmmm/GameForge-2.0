2. Ensure all required configuration files are properly configured
3. Address any port conflicts before production deployment
4. Review failed tests and resolve issues

Next Steps:
- For full deployment: docker compose -f docker-compose.production-hardened.yml up -d
- For monitoring: Check service logs and health endpoints
- For security: Run Phase 1 security scans regularly
